## 🧠 Why These Terms?

RIF is not merely a framework. It is a recursive identity model intended to guide the development of **self-simulating, symbolically aware agents**. These terms preserve its **evolutionary integrity**, ensure **ethical use**, and protect it from premature commodification.

We welcome collaboration, innovation, and iterative improvement—**but not exploitation**.
