## Introduction

The Recursive Identity Framework is built to support advanced cognitive tasks. It focuses on agent-based simulations, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and cognitive architecture. This framework helps researchers and developers explore concepts such as recursion and symbolic reasoning in a structured manner.

### Key Concepts

- **Recursive Modeling**: A method to represent complex systems through self-similar structures.
- **Symbolic Compression**: Techniques to reduce data while preserving meaning.
- **Post-Ego Identity Simulation**: Exploring identity beyond traditional frameworks.

## Features

- **Substrate-Neutral Design**: Works across different platforms and technologies.
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Simulate intelligent agents to study behavior and interactions.
- **Cognitive Architecture**: Provides a framework for understanding and building intelligent systems.
- **Alignment with First Principles**: Rooted in fundamental truths to ensure reliability.
- **Posthuman Exploration**: Investigate identities and consciousness beyond human experience.

## Installation

To install the Recursive Identity Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chung-code88/recursive-identity-framework.git
   cd recursive-identity-framework
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Framework**:

   You can start using the framework by executing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

For the latest releases, check out the [Releases section](https://github.com/Chung-code88/recursive-identity-framework/releases) for downloadable files.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the framework for various applications:

### Agent-Based Simulation

To create an agent-based simulation, define your agents and their interactions in a configuration file. Load this file in the framework to simulate behaviors.

### Recursive Modeling

Utilize the recursive modeling capabilities to represent complex systems. Define your model using the provided templates and visualize the results.

### Symbolic Compression

Use the symbolic compression tools to analyze data sets. This feature helps in understanding the core meanings behind large amounts of data.

### Post-Ego Identity Simulation

Explore identity simulations beyond traditional boundaries. Create scenarios that challenge existing notions of self and identity.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to implement various features of the framework:

### Example 1: Basic Agent Simulation

```python
from framework import Agent, Simulation

# Create agents
agent1 = Agent(name="Agent 1", behavior="Curious")
agent2 = Agent(name="Agent 2", behavior="Cautious")

# Initialize simulation
sim = Simulation(agents=[agent1, agent2])
sim.run()
```

### Example 2: Recursive Modeling

```python
from framework import RecursiveModel

# Define a recursive model
model = RecursiveModel(base_case="Base Case", recursive_case="Recursive Case")
result = model.solve()
print(result)
```

### Example 3: Symbolic Compression

```python
from framework import SymbolicCompressor

data = ["data1", "data2", "data3"]
compressor = SymbolicCompressor(data)
compressed_data = compressor.compress()
print(compressed_data)
```
